        <strong>HEY!❤️</strong> <br />
        <em>
          Ion really know, what will happen this 2025 <br />
          But what I do know is I, will always be around for you! <br />
          I know I've said that 1,000,000+ times, <br />
          But I hope you know that I'm not going anywhere, I'll always be by
          you. <br />
          I love you and I care for you, I'm proud of you, in all that you do
          <br />
          You came in as a blessing to me, in 2022, '23, and '24 <br />
          I thank God for you! <br />
          The way you talked about Archers voice so much I knew it had to be the
          top book of the year <br />
          Wasnt exactly sure so what I did was take note of all the books you
          loved, read them all and had lines from each and every one to use
          whenever I write to you <br />

          "You're the best thing that's ever happened to me. You make me want to
          be a better man, for you." <br />
          Joan I wish you nothing but the best this year, nothing but the
          complete best <br />
          I pray that You may acheive your Heart's desire! ❤️ <br />
          Happy New Year, Joan Gail Nyambura Karanja!
